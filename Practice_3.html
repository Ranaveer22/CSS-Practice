    The <strong>cinnamon hummingbird (<em>Amazilia rutila</em>)</strong> is a species of hummingbird 
    (named for its brilliant brown gold color) in the tribe of the 'emeralds', Trochilini 
    (subfamily Trochilinae). Currently, four regional subspecies are recognized.<br><br>
    Cinnamon hummingbirds are typically found at or just slightly above sea level, often inhabiting 
    coastal and lowland areas, as well as further inland in warmer locations in the southern parts of 
    their range. They are predominantly found along the Pacific western coast of México and south through
    Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. They are also found in Belize and the 
    southern Mexican states of Campeche, Quintana Roo and Yucatán.</blockquote>
